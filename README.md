This is my console app code for the TMSPH Backend Test. It is a Car Rental Problem that:

1. Read input number (seat) from the command line
2. Calculate optimized cost (the cheapest) from the specified number (seat) and print results.

I programmed it using C# programming language through Visual Studio Code
